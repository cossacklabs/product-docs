# Commercial support

If you would like to receive a one-time or prolonged customised assistance in implementing Hermes for the needs of your app/service, consider taking a look on Cossack Labs [Product security solutions](https://www.cossacklabs.com/solutions/product-security-ssdlc/).

## Licensing and commercial support

Hermes-core license is GNU Affero General Public License v3.0.

There is a separate, commercial licensed Hermes version for industrial use (its core crypto code is similar to this repository, yet it holds additional convenience interfaces and services). A commercial license can include custom cryptographic engineering (building cryptographic scheme based on Hermes for your use-case) and engineering support.

Drop us an email to [info@cossacklabs.com](mailto:info@cossacklabs.com) if you are interested.
