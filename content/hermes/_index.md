# Hermes in a nutshell

_What Hermes is and why it's awesome_

## What Hermes is

Hermes â€” cryptographic framework for building multi-user end-to-end encrypted data storage and sharing/processing with zero leakage risks from storage and transport infrastructure (so called end-to-end encrypted zero knowledge architectures).

Hermes acts as a protected data circulation layer with cryptographic access control for your distributed application, with zero security risk of data exposure from servers and storage.

Hermes allows deploying end-to-end encrypted data exchange, sharing, and collaboration in your apps. Hermes is platform-agnostic: it works for mobile, web, or server applications storing data in any database/datastore.
