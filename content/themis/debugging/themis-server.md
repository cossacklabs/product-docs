# Themis Server

Themis Server (aka _Themis Interactive Simulator_) was web server that could be used as a remote debugging aid. Themis server worked as a "server-side" and allowed debugging client-server interactions, like encryption using Secure Message or Secure Session.

While we truly enjoyed the idea of having interactive simulator to play with, Themis Server was not very popular, but used our time and budget on its support and servers rent.

In Dec 2021, we've sunset Themis Server.

If you are looking to debug Themis interactions, we recommend using [Themis CLI utilities](/themis/debugging/cli-utilities/) â€“ just install pythemis or gothemis on your machine and use it as a "server".
