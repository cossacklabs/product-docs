# Migration guides

We strive to maintain strict backwards compatibility, so most updates between Themis versions are easy and quick.
However, sometimes incompatibility issues arise
and we have to introduce breaking changes.

{{< hint info >}}
**Don't worry,**
we always do this gradually and never change or remove API on a short notice.

You can expect a grace period of at least half a year:
one or several releases during which you can update your application code.
The warnings will be published here,
[in the changelog](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md),
and in every release announcement.
{{< /hint >}}

If you're updating Themis, you might need to take extra steps for some versions.
Check out the corresponding migration guide.
