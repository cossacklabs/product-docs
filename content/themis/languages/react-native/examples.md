# Example projects with React Native

Once you have [installed React Native Themis](../installation/), it’s time to give it some action!

## Code samples

TBD

Some code samples for Themis features are available
at [`docs/examples/swift`](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/tree/master/docs/examples/swift)
on GitHub:

  - data encryption using Secure Cell
  - message encryption using Secure Message
  - password authentication using Secure Comparator
  - integration with SPM, CocoaPods and Carthage for macOS and iOS

You can also take a look at unit tests
in [SwiftThemis source code](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/tree/master/tests/objcthemis).
