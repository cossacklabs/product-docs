# Configuring key storage

Key storage (and related key management) is one of Acra's core components responsible for security guarantees.

Refer to [Acra in depth / Key storage and KMS](/acra/acra-in-depth/architecture/key-storage-and-kms/) to learn about general key storage considerations.

Refer to [Security controls / Key management](/acra/security-controls/key-management/) to learn how to generate cryptographic keys.

Refer to [KV stores](/acra/configuring-maintaining/key-storing/kv-stores) to learn where to store keys and how to point Acra to Redis.

Refer to [KMS integration](/acra/configuring-maintaining/key-storing/kms-integration) to learn what types of KMS are supported by Acra and where to store Acra Master Key.
