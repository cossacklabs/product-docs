## Data security consulting

It takes more than just getting cryptographic code to compile to secure sensitive data. Acra won’t make you “compliant out of the box” with all the modern security regulations, and no other tool will.

We help companies plan their data security strategy by auditing, assessing data flow, and classifying the data, enumerating the risks. We do the hardest, least-attended part of reaching the compliance – turning it from the “cost of doing business” into the “security framework that prevents risks”. Consider [getting in touch](mailto:sales@cossacklabs.com) if you are looking for data security assistance.
