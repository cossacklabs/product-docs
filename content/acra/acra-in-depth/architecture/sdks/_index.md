# Acra SDKs in general

{{< hint info >}}
All Acra SDKs are available in [Acra Enterprise Edition](/acra/enterprise-edition/) only.
{{< /hint>}}

Acra provides a number of different SDKs that enable more in-depth usage of Acra's capabilities. By default, all necessary wrapper libraries are available only to commercial customers, but eventually it might change. 

Acra provides optional client-side SDKs for encrypting data – [AcraWriter](/acra/acra-in-depth/architecture/sdks/acrawriter/), for decrypting data – [AcraReader](/acra/acra-in-depth/architecture/sdks/acrareader/), and for working with AcraTranslator – [SDK for AcraTranslator](/acra/acra-in-depth/architecture/sdks/acratranslator-sdk/).
