# Getting started

## Get started, easily

We've made sure that this documentation service covers maximum of Acra's capabilities and configuration nuances. However, it is a considerable effort to do thorough study, so there are a few shortcuts for those willing to get their hands dirty faster:

* [Trying Acra](/acra/getting-started/trying/) (many ways to get a fully working Acra from scratch).
* [Installing](/acra/getting-started/installing/) (typical Acra installation ways).
* Guides:
  * [AcraServer-based workflow](/acra/guides/integrating-acra-server-into-infrastructure/#integrating-acra-server-into-infrastructure/).
  * [AcraTranslator-based workflow](/acra/guides/integrating-acra-translator-into-new-infrastructure/#usage-of-acratranslator).
