# Security automation via programmatic reactions

Acra allows configuring particular behaviour on security events. When triggered, they alert your Ops team and define a wide gamut of reactions - from shutting down or rejecting the request to providing forged data instead of actual database response.

Acra Community Edition supports configurable reactions for [Intrusion detection](/acra/security-controls/intrusion-detection/). You can configure AcraServer and AcraTranslator to shut down or to launch any script upon detecting poison record in a database response.

Acra Enterprise Edition supports more customized reactions for many more security events.
