AcraWriter is available in [Acra Enterprise Edition](/acra/enterprise-edition/) only.

These guides describe a process of tuning up Ruby on Rails application for encrypting data on client-side using [AcraWriter](/acra/acra-in-depth/architecture/sdks/acrawriter/) before sending data to the AcraServer or the database.

Refer to a [Integrating Acra with RoR app: short tutorial](ruby-on-rails-acra-short-tutorial) if you are already familiar with Acra.

Refer to a [Integrating Acra with RoR app: step-by-step tutorial](ruby-on-rails-acra-step-by-step-tutorial) for full step-by-step guide.

{{< hint warning >}}
**Note:**
Guides above were tested only for Acra version 0.85 and could be outdated for actual version of Acra.

However, the [engineering examples](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra-engineering-demo/) contain working RoR example you can refer to.
