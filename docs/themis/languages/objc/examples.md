# Example projects with ObjCThemis

Once you have [installed ObjCThemis](../installation), it’s time to give it some action!

## Code samples

Some code samples for Themis features are available
at [`docs/examples/objc`](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/tree/master/docs/examples/objc)
on GitHub:

  - data encryption using Secure Cell
  - message encryption using Secure Message
  - password authentication using Secure Comparator
  - integration with CocoaPods and Carthage for macOS and iOS

You can also take a look at unit tests
in [ObjCThemis source code](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/tree/master/tests/objcthemis).

## Blog posts

You can read our blog post on [building encrypted chat service](https://www.cossacklabs.com/building-secure-chat),
which includes iOS client using Secure Session and Secure Cell.

Another blog post on [usability testing](https://www.cossacklabs.com/02-usability-testing.html)
explored usage of Secure Message in iOS and Python.
Here’s the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis-ux-testing) with the code

## Debugging aids

[Themis Server examples](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/tree/master/docs/examples/Themis-server/Obj-C)
can be used with [Themis Interactive Simulator](https://docs.cossacklabs.com/simulator/interactive/):
you can generate the keys and simulate whole client-server communication.
Read more in the [Themis Server guide](/docs/themis/debugging/themis-server).
