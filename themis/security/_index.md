# On Themis security

Each change in Themis is being reviewed and approved
by our internal team of cryptographers and security engineers.
For every release, we perform internal audits by cryptographers who don't work on Themis.

We use a lot of automated security testing:
e.g., static code analysers, fuzzing tools, memory analysers, unit tests (for each platform),
integration tests (to find compatibility issues between different platforms).
Read more about our security testing practices
[in this blog series](https://dev.to/cossacklabs/automated-software-security-testing-for-devs-part-1-gcf).

If you believe that you've found a security-related issue,
please drop us an email to [dev@cossacklabs.com](mailto:dev@cossacklabs.com).
Bug bounty program may apply.
