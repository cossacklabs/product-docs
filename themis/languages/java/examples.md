# Example projects with JavaThemis

Once you have installed JavaThemis
(for [Android](../installation-android/) or [desktop](../installation-desktop/) development),
it’s time to give it some action!

## Code samples

[Themis Java examples](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis-java-examples)
illustrate how to integrate JavaThemis into Android and desktop Java projects
and how JavaThemis API can be used:

  - data encryption using Secure Cell
  - exchange messages using Secure Message
  - establish connections with Secure Session

You can also take a look at unit tests
in [JavaThemis source code](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/tree/master/tests/themis/wrappers/android/com/cossacklabs/themis/test).

## Blog posts

You can read our blog post on [building encrypted chat service](https://www.cossacklabs.com/building-secure-chat),
which includes Android client using Secure Session and Secure Cell.

## Debugging aids

[Themis Server examples](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/tree/master/docs/examples/Themis-server/java)
can be used with [Themis Interactive Simulator](/simulator/interactive/):
you can generate the keys and simulate whole client-server communication.
Read more in the [Themis Server guide](/themis/debugging/themis-server/).
