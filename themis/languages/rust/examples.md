# Example projects with RustThemis

Once you have [installed RustThemis](../installation/), it’s time to give it some action!

## Code samples

Some code samples for Themis features are available
at [`docs/examples/rust`](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/tree/master/docs/examples/rust)
on GitHub:

  - key generation utilities
  - data encryption using Secure Cell
  - a simple chat server and client using Secure Message and Secure Session
  - password authentication using Secure Comparator

You can also take a look at unit tests
in [RustThemis source code](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/tree/master/tests/rust).

## Debugging aids

There are [command-line utilities](/themis/debugging/cli-utilities/#rust)
which you can `cargo run` from GitHub source code
at [`tools/rust`](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/tree/master/tools/rust).
