# Example projects with WasmThemis

Once you have [installed WasmThemis](../installation/), it’s time to give it some action!

## Code samples

Some code samples for Themis features are available
at [`docs/examples/js`](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/tree/master/docs/examples/js)
on GitHub:

  - key generation utilities
  - data encryption using Secure Cell
  - message encryption using Secure Message
  - a simple chat server and client using Secure Session
  - password authentication using Secure Comparator

You can also take a look at unit tests
in [WasmThemis source code](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/tree/master/src/wrappers/themis/wasm/test).

## Debugging aids

There are [command-line utilities](/themis/debugging/cli-utilities/#javascript-webassembly)
that you can run with `node` from GitHub source code
at [`tools/js/wasm-themis`](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/tree/master/tools/js/wasm-themis).
