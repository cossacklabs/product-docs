# Example projects with JavaThemis

Once you have [installed JavaThemis](../installation-android/) for Android
it’s time to give it some action!

## Code samples

See the [`docs/examples/android`](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/tree/master/docs/examples/android)
directory on GitHub for an sample project with JavaThemis for Android.
There you can find examples of JavaThemis API:

  - data encryption using Secure Cell
  - exchange messages using Secure Message
  - establish connections with Secure Session

You can also take a look at unit tests
in [JavaThemis source code](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/tree/master/tests/themis/wrappers/android/com/cossacklabs/themis/test).

## Blog posts

You can read our blog post on [building encrypted chat service](https://www.cossacklabs.com/building-secure-chat),
which includes Android client using Secure Session and Secure Cell.

## Debugging aids

[Themis Server examples](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/tree/master/docs/examples/Themis-server/java)
can be used with [Themis Interactive Simulator](/simulator/interactive/):
you can generate the keys and simulate whole client-server communication.
Read more in the [Themis Server guide](/themis/debugging/themis-server/).
