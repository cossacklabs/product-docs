# Example projects with RbThemis

Once you have [installed RbThemis](../installation/), it’s time to give it some action!

## Code samples

Some code samples for Themis features are available
at [`docs/examples/ruby`](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/tree/master/docs/examples/ruby)
on GitHub:

  - key generation utilities
  - data encryption using Secure Cell
  - message encryption using Secure Message
  - a simple chat server and client using Secure Session
  - password authentication using Secure Comparator

You can also take a look at unit tests
in [RbThemis source code](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/tree/master/tests/rbthemis).

## Blog posts

You can read our blog post on [building encrypted chat service](https://www.cossacklabs.com/building-secure-chat)
which shows Themis in action for building a websocket server in Ruby.
The code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/cossacklabs/mobile-websocket-example).

## Debugging aids

There are [command-line utilities](/docs/themis/debugging/cli-utilities/#ruby)
that you can run from GitHub source code
at [`tools/ruby`](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/tree/master/tools/ruby).

[Themis Server examples](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/tree/master/docs/examples/Themis-server/ruby)
can be used with [Themis Interactive Simulator](/simulator/interactive/):
you can generate the keys and simulate whole client-server communication.
Read more in the [Themis Server guide](/docs/themis/debugging/themis-server/).
