# Using Themis in PHP

- **[Data storage at rest](features/#secure-cell)**:
  encrypt sensitive data for storage with symmetric cryptography.
- **[Authenticated messaging](features/#secure-message)**:
  exchange messages which are readable only by the recipent using asymmetric cryptography,
  or sign messages with your private key to prove identity.
