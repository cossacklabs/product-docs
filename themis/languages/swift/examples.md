# Example projects with SwiftThemis

Once you have [installed SwiftThemis](../installation/), it’s time to give it some action!

## Code samples

Some code samples for Themis features are available
at [`docs/examples/swift`](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/tree/master/docs/examples/swift)
on GitHub:

  - data encryption using Secure Cell
  - message encryption using Secure Message
  - password authentication using Secure Comparator
  - integration with CocoaPods and Carthage for macOS and iOS

You can also take a look at unit tests
in [SwiftThemis source code](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/tree/master/tests/objcthemis).

## Blog posts

The [Swift Alps demo project](https://github.com/cossacklabs/theswiftalpsdemo)
demonstrates the usage of Secure Cell and Secure Session,
with a live server.

## Debugging aids

[Themis Server examples](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/tree/master/docs/examples/Themis-server/swift)
can be used with [Themis Interactive Simulator](/simulator/interactive/):
you can generate the keys and simulate whole client-server communication.
Read more in the [Themis Server guide](/themis/debugging/themis-server/).
