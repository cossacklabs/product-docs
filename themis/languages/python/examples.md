# Example projects with PyThemis

Once you have [installed PyThemis](../installation/), it’s time to give it some action!

## Code samples

Some code samples for Themis features are available
at [`docs/examples/python`](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/tree/master/docs/examples/python)
on GitHub:

  - key generation utilities
  - data encryption using Secure Cell
  - message encryption using Secure Message
  - a simple chat server and client using Secure Session
  - password authentication using Secure Comparator

You can also take a look at unit tests
in [PyThemis source code](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/tree/master/tests/pythemis).

## Blog posts

A blog post on [usability testing](https://www.cossacklabs.com/02-usability-testing.html)
explores usage of Secure Message in iOS and Python.
Here’s the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis-ux-testing) with the code.

## Debugging aids

There are [command-line utilities](/docs/themis/debugging/cli-utilities/#python)
that you can run from GitHub source code
at [`tools/python`](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/tree/master/tools/python).

[Themis Server examples](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/tree/master/docs/examples/Themis-server/python)
can be used with [Themis Interactive Simulator](/simulator/interactive/):
you can generate the keys and simulate whole client-server communication.
Read more in the [Themis Server guide](/docs/themis/debugging/themis-server/).
