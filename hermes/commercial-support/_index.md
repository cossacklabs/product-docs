## Contacts and assistance

If you would like to receive a one-time or prolonged customised assistance in implementing Hermes for the needs of your app/service, consider participating in our [Customer Success Program](https://www.cossacklabs.com/services/customer-success-program/).

Although Hermes-core is an in-house-developed product by [Cossack Labs Limited](https://www.cossacklabs.com/), it is still open-source software. This means you can hack it any way you want and contribute things back if you'd like to. As a software company, we focus on implementing features that are important to our products but would gladly spend some time on making Hermes useful for everybody.

#### "I'd like to help somehow, but don't know what will be useful. What should I do?"

If you're looking for something to contribute to and gain our eternal respect (or something more tangible - you might be in for a surprise when contributing to us, who knows ;), just pick the things in the [list of issues](https://github.com/cossacklabs/hermes-core/issues).

If you'd like to do independent parts (implement new procedures/objects, do a language wrapper or a set of examples for languages or architectures we don't have and don't even plan yet) - just go ahead and let us know when you finish.

We highly encourage you to:

* Report bugs and request features via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/cossacklabs/hermes-core/issues).
* Report a bug and fix it with a patch via our [GitHub Pull request](https://github.com/cossacklabs/hermes-core/pulls) (after creating a corresponding issue and leaving a link to the pull there).
* Add something new to Hermes-core. There is a certain design scheme according to which we'd like to keep developing Hermes-core. If your contributions fall along with it, we'd be glad to accept some fundamental additions. It's better to discuss the subject using [email](mailto:dev@cossacklabs.com) before taking action.

Every commit that goes into the master branch is audited and reviewed by somebody from Cossack Labs, don't be surprised if the process is long-ish.

If you'd like to participate in the core development more closely and deeply, get in touch.

## Licensing and commercial support

Hermes-core license is GNU Affero General Public License v3.0.

There is a separate, commercial licensed Hermes version for industrial use (its core crypto code is similar to this repository, yet it holds additional convenience interfaces and services). A commercial license can include custom cryptographic engineering (building cryptographic scheme based on Hermes for your use-case) and engineering support.

Drop us an email to [info@cossacklabs.com](mailto:info@cossacklabs.com) if you are interested.
