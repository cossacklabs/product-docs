## Hermes and GDPR/HIPAA/CCPA

Hermes can help you reach better compliance with the current data privacy regulations, such as:

* [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://gdpr-info.eu/)
* [HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act)
* [DPA (Data Protection Act)](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/contents/enacted)
* [CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Consumer_Privacy_Act)

As a framework for cryptographically assured access control and data security, Hermes is a ["state of the art"](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-32-gdpr/) cryptographic tool. Configuring and using Hermes in a designated form will cover most of the demands described in articles 25, 32, 33, and 34 of GDPR and the PII data protection demands of HIPAA and CCPA.
