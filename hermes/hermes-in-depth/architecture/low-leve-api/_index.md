# LOW-LEVEL API

Besides the high-level calls, Hermes-core also contains low-level API, which allows the developer to call parts of the process separately, for complex integration cases. The headers of the low-level API can be found in `master/include/hermes/mid_hermes_ll` and the implementations are in `master/src/mid_hermes_ll`.

However, the low-level API is not documented for the time being as it is not recommended for use without prior communication and interaction with Cossack Labs' engineers. If you would still like to have your way with the low-level API, contact us via [info@cossacklabs.com](mailto:info@cossacklabs.com).
