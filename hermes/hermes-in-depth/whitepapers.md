There is a scientific paper on Hermes, which you can read [here](https://www.cossacklabs.com/files/hermes-theory-paper-rev1.pdf) on the Cossack Labs website (or find it in the [IACR Eprint Archive](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/200)). More practical considerations about using Hermes and it's proof of concept implementation which is Hermes-core you can find in the [Implementation paper](https://www.cossacklabs.com/hermes/implementing-hermes-based-systems/) section on our website.
