Acra can work in API proxy by Acra SDKs or AcraTranslator and building proxy layer around it.
In enterprise version, we bring different nuts'n'bolts to make it easier. This page will be populated with details eventually. 

# Which FRs/NFRs does it implement

* Stay tuned, folks!

# How it connects to other parts

API proxy works between several API-driven microservices/applications, remote API party for them. API proxy can transparently forward requests/responses while encrypting/decrypting. It can also do tokenisation, masking, authentication, and, in some cases, translate between different RPC protocols. 
translate between different RPC protocols.

The exact feature set of API proxy is defined by you and we can help with implementing it.

# What are architectural considerations?

* Stay tuned, folks!
