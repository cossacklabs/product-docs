# How it works

Acra can work in AnyProxy by Acra SDKs or AcraTranslator and building proxy layer around it.
In enterprise version, we bring different nuts'n'bolts to make it easier. This page will be populated with details eventually. 

# Which FRs/NFRs does it implement

* Stay tuned, folks!

# How it connects to other parts

AnyProxy works between several API-driven microservices/applications, remote API party for them. AnyProxy can transparently forward requests/responses while encrypting/decrypting. It can also do tokenisation, masking, authentication, and, in some cases, translate between different RPC protocols.

The exact feature set of AnyProxy is defined by you and we can help with implementing it.

# What are architectural considerations?

* Stay tuned, folks!
