Acra has been designed as a construction kit for integrating application-level encryption / field-level encryption into modern cloud apps. Since it can be applied in very different environments in different ways, in-depth understanding of it's design and underlying technology can not only tame your curiosity, but also enable more efficeint deployments, less operational friction and unlocking of hidden CLI super-mario port (just kidding on this one). 

This section touches on design concepts and high-level approaches.
