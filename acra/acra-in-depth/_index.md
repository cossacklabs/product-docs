# Acra in depth

Acra has been designed as a construction kit for integrating application-level encryption / field-level encryption into modern cloud apps. 

Since it can be applied in very different environments in different ways, in-depth understanding of its design and underlying technology can not only tame your curiosity, but also enable more efficient deployments, less operational friction and unlocking of hidden CLI super-mario port (just kidding on this one).

This section touches on design concepts, security engineering, best practices, and high-level approaches.
