## AcraStruct validator

To decrypt AcraStructs generated by AcraWriter in your application, you can also use our [AcraStruct validator](/simulator/acra/). It works as AcraServer / AcraTranslator and uses private decryption keys.

### Getting started with AcraStruct validator

To use AcraStruct validator, you need to register (or login if you have already registered) using your email address (don't worry, no spam from us):

1. Click "Register" in the top right corner of Documentation Server (or skip over to Step 3 if you've already registered).

2. Register using your email address and create a password (we're feeling awkward reminding you about it, but you should use a unique strong password, always).

3. Login using your password and email address.

### Using AcraStruct validator

If you don't have access to your AcraServer and private keys, use our keys:

1. Copy our AcraServer public key, paste in your AcraWriter, generate AcraStruct. Convert AcraStruct to base64 and paste in the form.
2. If you are using Zone, paste ZoneID as well.

If you wish to use your own private keys, click the blue selector switch and make sure it has turned from blue to green:

1. Make sure you have correct keys (public and private storage keypair for encrypting and decrypting data). If you don't have a keypair, use [AcraKeymaker]({{< ref "acra/acra-in-depth/cryptography-and-key-management#key-names-and-locations-INVALID" >}}) to generate it.

2. Use your public data encryption key in AcraWriter to generate AcraStruct. Convert AcraStruct to base64 and paste into the appropriate form.

> Note that AcraKeymaker encrypts private data decryption key. Paste ACRA_MASTER_KEY (usually placed in AcraServer/AcraTranslator) and private data decryption key (base64).

3. If you are using Zone, paste ZoneID as well. Do not forget to use Zone keys instead of data encryption and decryption keys.
