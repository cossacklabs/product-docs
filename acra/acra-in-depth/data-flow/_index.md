# Data flow

So, which Acra services and components you need? Depends on your use case! Let's see some typical dataflows.

Not sure what is AcraServer or AcraTranslator? Get back to [Acra-in-depth / Architecture](/acra/acra-in-depth/architecture/) section.

## Simple data flow schemas

### Simplest version with SQL proxy

`App <> AcraServer <> SQL database`

It's a classic scenario: AcraServer sits between your application (or database-facing microservice) and the actual SQL database, encrypting and decrypting data, providing masking/tokenization, even filtering SQL requests if you like.

#### When to use

If you are using MySQL/PostgreSQL database and want to integrate Acra "transparently" for your app.

#### Which components to use

[AcraServer](/acra/acra-in-depth/architecture/acraserver/), [Key management utilities](/acra/security-controls/key-management/), [Key storage](/acra/acra-in-depth/architecture/key-storage/), [KMS](/acra/acra-in-depth/architecture/key-storage/) and [TLS transport encryption](/acra/security-controls/transport-security/tls/).


#### Writing

`Application --> AcraServer --> SQL database`

Application sends data to database through AcraServer in [Transparent encryption mode](/acra/configuring-maintaining/controls-configuration-on-acraserver/). You configure AcraServer indicating which fields to encrypt/decrypt/mask/tokenize.

All data manipulations like [encryption](/acra/security-controls/encryption/), [searchable encryption](/acra/security-controls/searchable-encryption/), [tokenization](/acra/security-controls/tokenization/), [masking](/acra/security-controls/masking/) applied on AcraServer side before sending data to database. 

If [SQL firewall is configured](/acra/security-controls/sql-firewall/), AcraServer applies SQL request filtering.

#### Reading

`Application <-- AcraServer <-- SQL database`

Application requests data from a database through AcraServer. AcraServer transparently decrypts/detokenizes/unmasks data and passes it to the application.


### Simplest version with API service

`App <> AcraTranslator, App <> Datastore`

Another classic scenario: your application speaks to the API service to encrypt/decrypt/mask/unmask/tokenize/detokenize data, and then stores it in the datastore or sends to the otehr application.

This scenario is also known as Encryption-as-a-service.

#### When to use

If you are using NoSQL / KV datastore and want your application to be responsible for calling encryption service and then storing the data.

#### Which components to use

[AcraTranslator](/acra/acra-in-depth/architecture/acratranslator/), [Key management utilities](/acra/security-controls/key-management/), [Key storage](/acra/acra-in-depth/architecture/key-storage/), [KMS](/acra/acra-in-depth/architecture/key-storage/) and [TLS transport encryption](/acra/security-controls/transport-security/tls/).

#### Writing

`Application --> AcraTranslator --> Application --> Datastore`

Application knows which fields to encrypt/mask/tokenize. Application sends these fields to AcraTranslator via gRPC or HTTP API. AcraTranslator performs required function and sends protected data back to the app. The app is responsible to store the received data.

#### Reading

`Application <-- AcraTranslator <-- Application <-- Datastore`

Application reads encrypted data from the storage or the other application and needs to decrypt/demask/detokenize it. Application sends these fields to AcraTranslator via gRPC or HTTP API. AcraTranslator performs required function and sends original data back to the app. The app is responsible to use the data.



### AnyProxy

`App <> DAO (<> AT or AS) <> other API`

Application needs to access sensitive data, which is stored separately encrypted. Application sends requests to DAO (data access object), that is responsible for reading the encrypted data from the datastore, decrypting it using AcraTranslator and sending it back to the requested application.

#### When to use

When sensitive data is isolated into separate database / table, and there're several applications that need to access it in plaintext: typicall apps and BI tools, for example. Instead of teaching these tools to talk to Acra, you create a separate service â€“ DAO, that is responsible for talking to Acra and encrypting/decrypting data. Other apps just talk to DAO.

Depending on the database that you use, DAO can talk to AcraServer (for SQL databases) or AcraTranslator (NoSQL/KV).

#### Which components to use

[AnyProxy](/acra/acra-in-depth/architecture/anyproxy/), [AcraTranslator](/acra/acra-in-depth/architecture/acratranslator/) or [AcraServer](/acra/acra-in-depth/architecture/acraserver/), [Key management utilities](/acra/security-controls/key-management/), [Key storage](/acra/acra-in-depth/architecture/key-storage/), [KMS](/acra/acra-in-depth/architecture/key-storage/) and [TLS transport encryption](/acra/security-controls/transport-security/tls/).

#### Writing

`Application --> DAO <> [AcraTranslator, AcraServer, Datastore] --> Application`

Application sends sensitive fields to DAO to protect. DAO communicates with AcraServer/AcraTranslator to encrypt/mask/tokenize the fields and stores them in a database/datastore.

#### Reading

`Application <-- DAO <> [AcraTranslator, AcraServer, Datastore] <-- Application`

Application asks DAO for sensitive fields in plaintext. DAO reads encrypted/masked/tokenized fields from the database/datastore, and communicates with AcraServer/AcraTranslator to decrypt/demask/untokenize the fields. DAO receives plaintext fields and sends them back to the application.



## Long data lifecycle

Acra was built to accompany sensitive data lifecycle in large, microservice-driven applications. So you can use APIs inside applications and proxies between some services and databases to build pretty sophisticated lifecycles.

### End-to-end encrypted dataflow

`App [AcraWriter] <> Datastore <> App [AcraReader]`

Application uses AcraWriter SDK to encrypt data on application side, and then stores data in a database/datastore. Application reads encrypted data and uses AcraRead SDK to decrypt it.

#### When to use

When some parts of the dataflow should be end-to-end encrypted. We strongly advise to combine this approach with typical dataflow using AcraServer/AcraTranslator - meaning, that some apps will use Acra server-side as designed, while some apps will process data on client-side only.

#### Which components to use

[Client-side SDKs](/acra/acra-in-depth/architecture/sdks/), [Key management utilities](/acra/security-controls/key-management/), [Key storage](/acra/acra-in-depth/architecture/key-storage/), [KMS](/acra/acra-in-depth/architecture/key-storage/) and [TLS transport encryption](/acra/security-controls/transport-security/tls/).

#### Writing

`Application [AcraWriter] --> Datastore`

Application locally encrypts sensitive data using AcraWriter. The app is responsible for accessing Acra's encryption keys. The app is responsible to store protected data.

#### Reading

`Application [AcraReader] <-- Datastore`

Application reads encrypted data from the datastore, locally decrypts it using AcraReader. The app is responsible for accessing Acra's decryption keys.  


### Client-side encryption, server-side decryption

`App [AcraWriter] <> AcraServer <> Database`

Application uses AcraWriter SDK to encrypt data on application side, and sends it to the database through AcraServer. Application reads the data through AcraServer that decrypts it. 

#### When to use

When the system will benefit from client-side encryption and security controls provided by AcraServer. One application can sends encrypted data ("writer"), other can read decrypted data through AcraServer ("readers").


#### Which components to use

[AcraWriter](/acra/acra-in-depth/architecture/sdks/), [AcraServer](/acra/acra-in-depth/architecture/acraserver/), [Key management utilities](/acra/security-controls/key-management/), [Key storage](/acra/acra-in-depth/architecture/key-storage/), [KMS](/acra/acra-in-depth/architecture/key-storage/) and [TLS transport encryption](/acra/security-controls/transport-security/tls/).

#### Writing

`Application [AcraWriter] --> AcraServer --> Database`

Application locally encrypts sensitive data using AcraWriter. The app is responsible for accessing Acra's encryption keys. Then the app sends data to the database directly or via AcraServer. AcraServer will detected encrypted data and won't encrypt it twice.

#### Reading

`Application <-- AcraServer <-- Database`

Application requests data from a database through AcraServer. AcraServer transparently decrypts/detokenizes/unmasks data and passes it to the application.
 


### Using AcraConnector and AcraServer

`App <> AcraConnector <> AcraServer <> Database`

Similar to the classic scenario the [simplest dataflow with AcraServer](/acra/acra-in-depth/data-flow/#simplest-version-with-sql-proxy), but the application uses AcraConnector for transport encryption.

[AcraConnector](/acra/security-controls/transport-security/acra-connector) uses TLS or Themis Secure Session to provide additional transport encryption and mutual authentication for apps that work in hostile environments.

#### When to use

When client-side application works in a hostile environment and extra transport security is required.

#### Which components to use

[AcraServer](/acra/acra-in-depth/architecture/acraserver/), [Key management utilities](/acra/security-controls/key-management/), [Key storage](/acra/acra-in-depth/architecture/key-storage/), [KMS](/acra/acra-in-depth/architecture/key-storage/) and [AcraConnector](/acra/security-controls/transport-security/acra-connector).

#### Writing

`Application --> AcraConnector --> AcraServer --> Database`

Application locally encrypts sensitive data using AcraWriter. The app is responsible for accessing Acra's encryption keys. Then the app sends data to the database directly or via AcraServer. AcraServer will detected encrypted data and won't encrypt it twice.

Application sends data to database through AcraServer in [Transparent encryption mode](/acra/configuring-maintaining/controls-configuration-on-acraserver/). AcraServer performs encryption, searchable encryption, masking, tokenization. Raw data is sent to AcraServer through AcraConnector that protects it using TLS or Themis Secure Session.

#### Reading

`Application <-- AcraConnector <-- AcraServer <-- Database`

Application requests data from a database through AcraServer. AcraServer transparently decrypts/detokenizes/unmasks data and passes it safely to the application using AcraConnector.
 

### Using AcraConnector and AcraTranslator

`App <> AcraConnector <> AcraTranslator, App <> Datastore`

Similar to the classic scenario the [simplest dataflow with AcraTranslator](/acra/acra-in-depth/data-flow/#simplest-version-with-api-service), but the application uses AcraConnector for transport encryption.

#### When to use

When client-side application works in a hostile environment and extra transport security is required.

#### Which components to use

[AcraTranslator](/acra/acra-in-depth/architecture/acratranslator/), [Key management utilities](/acra/security-controls/key-management/), [Key storage](/acra/acra-in-depth/architecture/key-storage/), [KMS](/acra/acra-in-depth/architecture/key-storage/) and [AcraConnector](/acra/security-controls/transport-security/acra-connector).

#### Writing

`Application --> AcraConnector --> AcraTranslator --> AcraConnector --> Application --> Datastore`

Application knows which fields to encrypt/mask/tokenize. Application sends these fields to AcraTranslator via gRPC or HTTP API. AcraTranslator performs required function and sends protected data back to the app. All data is sent through AcraConnector to protect plaintext data from application to AcraTranslator via TLS or Themis Secure Session. 

#### Reading

`Application <-- AcraConnector <-- AcraTranslator <-- AcraConnector <-- Application <-- Datastore`

Application reads encrypted data from the storage or the other application and needs to decrypt/demask/detokenize it. Application sends these fields to AcraTranslator via gRPC or HTTP API. AcraTranslator performs required function and sends original data back to the app. All data is sent through AcraConnector to protect plaintext data from application to AcraTranslator via TLS or Themis Secure Session. 


## Data flow with Zones

Data flow with [zones](/acra/security-controls/zones) are similar for schemas described above except several additional steps at the beginning:

* Zone generation via [acra-addzone](/acra/configuring-maintaining/general-configuration/acra-addzone) utility or [AcraServer's HTTP API](/acra/configuring-maintaining/general-configuration/acra-server/).
* [Specifying Zone ID](/acra/security-controls/zones) in requests to AcraTranslator or inside DB query to database through AcraServer.
