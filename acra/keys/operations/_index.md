# Operating Acra key store

Here are typical operations that you will need to perform when managing a key store:

  - [Generate keys](generation/) when deploying a new Acra instance.
  - [Back up keys](backup/) to prevent accidental data loss.
  - [Rotate keys](rotation/) to mitigate leaks and ensure continuous security.
  - [Destroy keys](destruction/) when they are no longer used.
