# Releases and updates

All releases of [Acra Community Edition](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/) is available on [Github Releases page](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/releases/tag/0.85.0). You can find Acra packages built for many operating systems and Docker. See the [Installation guide](/acra/configuring-maintaining/installing/).

We strive to make new Acra's versions compatible with the current ones. In rare cases when they are not, the documentation has described migration procedures. Most breaking changes are related to configuration file formats and improve Acra's UX while not breaking the encryption flow itself.

[Acra Enterprise Edition](/acra/enterprise-edition) is updated according to its internal schedule. Don't hesitate to contact [your sales representative](mailto:sales@cossacklabs.com) if you are looking for more information about Acra EE updates. All updates are propagated to the customers according to the signed agreements.
