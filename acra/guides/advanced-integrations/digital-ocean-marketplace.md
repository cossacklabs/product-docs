# Acra on DigitalOcean Marketplace

We always strive to make high-end security tools available to the general developer audience in a convenient fashion. Only by making data security accessible, we can ensure real security of sensitive data everywhere.

As another step towards our mission, we are proud to announce that [Acra encryption suite](https://www.cossacklabs.com/acra/) is now available as 1-Click App running in a [Droplet on DigitalOcean Marketplace](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/acra). See our [blog post](https://www.cossacklabs.com/blog/acra-digitalocean-marketplace.html) for more details.

DigitalOcean is known for its caring attitude towards development teams of any size. We share the same values and are delighted that Acra is the first data security tool on DigitalOcean Marketplace.

## Acra 1-Click App
Acra 1-Click App contains AcraServer, which can work in different modes, depending on the infrastructure: server-side encryption (Transparent proxy mode, where AcraServer both encrypts and decrypts the data) or client-side encryption (where client application encrypts the data and AcraServer only decrypts it).

You can configure AcraServer yourself or try it with pre-configured settings. Acra 1-Click App has an interactive configuration script that prepares AcraServer for work as a Transparent encryption proxy with a PostgreSQL database.

With DigitalOcean Acra 1-Click App, you get Acra Community Edition which is totally free. Acra is [also available as paid Acra Enterprise versions](https://www.cossacklabs.com/acra/#pricing) with additional features and extended support.

To use Acra 1-Click App in a production setting, you need to configure it for your exact situation and needs (generate your own keys, connect to your own database, use strong TLS, configure the SQL firewall, preferably use client-side encryption).
