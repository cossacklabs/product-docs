## Contributing to Acra

Although Acra is an in-house-developed product by [Cossack Labs Limited](https://www.cossacklabs.com), it is still open-source, Apache 2-licensed software. This means you can hack it in any way you want and contribute things back if you'd like to. As a software company, we focus on implementing features that are important to our products but would gladly spend some time on making Acra useful for everybody.

We highly encourage you to:

- Report bugs and request features via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/issues).
- Report a bug and fix it with a patch via our [GitHub Pull request](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/pulls) (after creating a corresponding issue and leaving a link to the pull there).
- Add something new to Acra. There is a certain design scheme according to which we'd like to keep developing Acra. If your contributions fall along with it, we'd be glad to accept some fundamental additions. It's better to discuss the subject using email before taking action (see below).

Every commit that goes into the master branch is audited and reviewed by somebody from Cossack Labs, so don't be surprised if it takes a bit long.

If you'd like to participate in the core development more deeply, get in touch.
