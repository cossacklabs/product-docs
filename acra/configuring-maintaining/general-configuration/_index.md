### General configuration
- Generate keypair (see how to do it [here]({{< ref "acra/acra-in-depth/cryptography-and-key-management/#generating-all-the-acra-keys-in-one-go-INVALID" >}})).
- Configure secure transport using [AcraConnector]({{< ref "acra/security-controls/transport-security/acra-connector.md#acraconnector-and-acrawriter-INVALID" >}}) or [TLS]({{< ref "acra/configuring-maintaining/tls/" >}}):
- Deploy [AcraServer]({{< ref "acra/configuring-maintaining/general-configuration/acra-server.md#getting-started-with-acraserver-INVALID" >}}) to a separate machine:
- Integrate AcraWriter closely following the [examples](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/tree/master/examples) and using either AcraConnector (if available on this machine) or direct TLS database connection.
- Test everything:

  1. Connect AcraConnector to AcraServer, send a regular request to your database through AcraConnector.<br/>_Result_: If you see the answer, AcraConnector and AcraWriter are able to connect and forward signals back and forth. It means that the network and the keys are fine.

  2. Upon integrating AcraWriter into your code, try generating an [AcraStruct]({{< ref "acra/acra-in-depth/data-structures/#understanding-acrastruct" >}}) from some payload.<br/>_Result_: If you succeed in running AcraWriter code, Themis library is installed properly and some of the keys are located in the expected place.

  3. Write a row with AcraStruct into the database, either directly or through AcraConnector. Request this row through AcraConnector.<br/>_Result_: If you see decrypted payload in the response, the scheme works properly.

- Thoroughly read the documentation.
- Use Acra!
