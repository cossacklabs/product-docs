# Policies and configuration sets

AcraCE runs based on one configuration file. Pretty sophisticated one, but that's still fairly limited. 

To enable Acra to be more flexible security control, apply different policies based on keys, origin and other factors, AcraEE features policy engine. We're in process of revamping configuration syntax and likely in the next release this section will get populated with new syntax.
