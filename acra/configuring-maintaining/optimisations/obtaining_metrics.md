# Obtaining metrics

Acra services provide some metrics for Jaeger when configured to do so. This includes
[AcraConnector]({{< ref "acra/configuring-maintaining/general-configuration/acra_connector/_index.md#jaeger" >}}),
[AcraServer]({{< ref "acra/configuring-maintaining/general-configuration/acra_server/_index.md#jaeger" >}}),
[AcraTranslator]({{< ref "acra/configuring-maintaining/general-configuration/acra_translator/_index.md#jaeger" >}}).

_TODO: Describe which metrics could be exported and what they mean_
