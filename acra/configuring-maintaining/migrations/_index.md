# Migration guides

We strive to maintain strict backwards compatibility, so most updates between Acra versions are easy and quick.
However, sometimes incompatibility issues arise, and we have to introduce breaking changes.


{{< hint info >}}
**Don't worry,**
we always do this gradually and never change or remove API on a short notice.

The warnings will be published here, [in the changelog](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md),
and in every release announcement.

If you're updating Acra, you might need to take extra steps for some versions.
Check out the corresponding migration guide.
