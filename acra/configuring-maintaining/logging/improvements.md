# Implementing a new logging format

If you think that Acra is missing some handy logging formats, feel free to open an [Issue](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/issues) and describe why you think it's important. Alternatively, you can add the required log formatter ([logging folder](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra-Q12021/tree/master/logging) is a good place to start) and open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/pulls).<br/>
We are grateful for contributions.
