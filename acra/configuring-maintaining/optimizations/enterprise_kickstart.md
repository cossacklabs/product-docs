# Enterprise kickstart

Depending on your system's configuration and Acra features used, the performance penalty might be 3..15%.

[Acra Enterprise Edition](/acra/enterprise-edition/) is generally faster than Acra Community Edition, and we provide additional assistance in optimizations. 

In some use cases, we suggest to explicitly disable some Acra's features to receive a better performance from Acra. In others, we assist how to change the dataflow, or re-structure the data to improve general performance of your system and get rid of bottlenecks.

Our engineering force is highly capable in reading logs & monitoring charts, and suggesting optimizations :) Use Acra Enterprise Edition, save the woods ðŸŒ³
