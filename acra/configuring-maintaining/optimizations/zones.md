# Zones performance

If you have a lot of resources to run Acra on, or a small number of users, you can map each user to a separate [Zone](/acra/security-controls/zones/). This will make each user compartmented key-wise.

The more Zones and Zone keys you've got, the longer it takes to scan through the database response.
