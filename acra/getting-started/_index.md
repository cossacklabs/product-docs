# Getting started

## Get started, easily

We've made sure that this documentation service covers maximum of Acra's capabilities and configuration nuances. However, it is a considerable effort to do thorough study, so there are a few shortcuts for those willing to get their hands dirty faster:

* [Trying Acra](/acra/getting-started/trying/) (many ways to get a fully working Acra from scratch)
* [Acra Engineering Demo](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra-engineering-demo#what-is-this) (illustrates different facets of using Acra, from infrastructure integration to certain narrow product security problems)
* [Installing](/acra/getting-started/installing/) (how to install Acra for normal use)
* [Acra with Django project]({{< ref "acra/guides/djangoproject-short-tutorial.md" >}}) (TODO step-by-step)
* [Acra with Ruby on Rails]({{< ref "acra/guides/ruby-on-rails-short-tutorial.md" >}}) (TODO step-by-step)
* [Acra server-based workflow](/acra/guides/integrating-acra-server-into-infrastructure/#integrating-acra-server-into-infrastructure/)
* [Acra translator-based workflow](/acra/guides/integrating-acra-translator-into-new-infrastructure/#usage-of-acratranslator)
* Advanced integrations: 
  * [Running Acra via DO marketplace](/acra/guides/advanced-integrations/digital-ocean-marketplace/)
  * [Client-side integration with Acra connector](http://127.0.0.1:8088/acra/guides/advanced-integrations/client-side-integration-with-acra-connector/#client-side-acraconnector-and-acrawriter)

## Enterprise

To get to learn more about enterprise version, please refer to the ["Acra Enterprise Edition"](/acra/enterprise-edition/) page.

### Evaluation playgrounds and pilots

For qualified potential customers interested in commercial version, we offer free playgrounds built around Acra EE and a number of demo applications - deployed in cloud of your choice, all set up for evaluation. Get your hands dirty without getting your hands dirty first! 

When certain customer use-cases require requires more effort than it is commercially reasonable to exert for free, we offer paid PoC's / pilots, where we build Acra deployment to your business requirements for a modest consulting fee. 

If you're interested in commercial version, please refer to (PLACEHOLDER for whatever the sales conversion funnel will be from here)
