# Get started, easily

We've made sure that this documentation service covers maximum of Acra's capabilities and configuration nuances. However, it is a considerable effort to do thorough study, so there are a few shortcuts for those willing to get their hands dirty faster: 

## Guides and howtos

**TODO: finish**

We have a growing list of guides in the [guides section]({{< ref "acra/guides" >}}): 

* Trying Acra with Docker
* [Acra with Django project]({{< ref "acra/guides/djangoproject-short-tutorial.md" >}}) (TODO step-by-step)
* [Acra with Ruby on Rails]({{< ref "acra/guides/ruby-on-rails-short-tutorial.md" >}}) (TODO step-by-step)
* Acra server-based workflow
* Acra translator-based workflow
* Advanced integrations: 
  * Running Acra via DO marketplace
  * Client-side integration with Acra connector

## Acra engineering demos

TODO: Finish

We devised a number of ``docker-compose``-based examples to get you going with Acra: 

* Link 
* Link 
* Link

They illustrate different facets of using Acra, from infrastructure integration to certain narrow product security problems. 

# Enterprise

To get to learn more about enterprise version, there are a few ways: 

## Evaluation playgrounds and pilots

For qualified potential customers interested in commercial version, we offer free playgrounds built around Acra EE and a number of demo applications - deployed in cloud of your choice, all set up for evaluation. Get your hands dirty without getting your hands dirty first! 

When certain customer use-cases require requires more effort than it is commercially reasonable to exert for free, we offer paid PoC's / pilots, where we build Acra deployment to your business requirements for a modest consulting fee. 

If you're interested in commercial version, please refer to (PLACEHOLDER for whatever the sales conversion funnel will be from here)
