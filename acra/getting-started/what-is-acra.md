# What is Acra? An overview.

Acra is a application-level encryption and data security toolkit for modern distributed applications. Acra allows application developers to encrypt sensitive data, manage the keys, apply tokenization, data masking, request filtering, generate audit logs and security events, automate reactions on security boundary - thus providing you with means to protect the data, detect incidents and respond to them. 

Acra is written in Go, aimed for modern cloud applications that store sensitive data in PostgreSQL/mySQL-compatible SQL databases, and any other datastores. Acra consists of a number of engines (SQL Proxy, API service/proxy, in-app SDK) that enable applying security controls to the data exactly where the data flows, with  crypto key storage syncronised between all components.

With Acra you can: 

* protect sensitive data from leakage and misuse via encryption, tokenization, data masking, request filtering and honeytokens. 
* gain deep visibility: generate audit trail for database queries and access events, generate security events for your SIEM system and monitoring events/metrics for your monitoring system.
* respond: automate some Acra's reactions to protect sensitive data and/or keys during security incidents. 

Aside from core security controls, Acra features a number of supporting mechanisms to make security implementation stronger and more convenient to use: 
* key management tooling, inlucluding advanced features like gradual key rolling; 
* searchable encryption to effiicently access some of the encrypted data
* [ENTERPRISE ONLY] expressive policy language that allows to configure Acra's behavior in very sophisticated ways

Acra essentially moves security boundary as close to the data itself as possible without sacrificing security and usability, and provides a number of defense-in-depth mechanisms to protect the data. 

## Why Acra

Acra allows you to protect sensitive data inside your infrastructure / product / distributed application efficiently, with a number of modern security contorls. There are many regulatory, business risk and security rigorousness reasons to use Acra, they are typical to usage of any data protection / leakage prevention / encryption software:

 * protecting sensitive data to prevent unauthorized parties from accessing it (including insiders and advanced persistent adversaries);
 * encrypting sensitive data due to compliance requirements;
 * building security boundary around sensitive data to protect and provide visibility into the way it is used; 
 * reinforcing database security measures with external security controls; 
 * building separate vaults of sensitive data with enhanced security;

Let's see how Acra is actually different from many products and approaches: 

### Application level encryption, field level encryption

Acra allows you to efficiently pick fields / parts of your data model (on application level) and encrypt them - either by listening to database wire protocol and substituting certain fields to their protected equivalents, or using other means. 

If done right, application-level encryption protects your sensitive data from more sensitive risks than other encryption modes. 

Application-level encryption brings plenty of application-specific benefits: 

* ALE enables mapping of keys to users/entities/tenants, BYOK, more advanced key layouts, etc. 
* ALE enables application developers and architects to distribute additional computing load and bottlenecks as they wish, thus making security less of a performance challenge, if it ever was. 

### Risk implications 

**TODO**: Insert our risk table 

Some relevant links: 
* MongoDB ALE
* Our risk table

* Acra changes your risk model drastically - you can now deal with many risks with less contorls, and you need to keep an eye on smaller variety of control implementations. 

* There is no application compomise scenario that leads to immediate massive data leak - there are no keys, secrets on application side that can be stolen, combined with database dump to decrypt the data. The only case for data leakage via compromised app that talks to database via Acra is for application to record sensitive data legitimately requested under regular process. 

* Acra changes attack surface to your data significantly - narrowing it to: 
	* Acra and it's supporting infrastructure
	* Application logic that queries data

* Security boundary is closer to data - so insiders, privileged attackers, DBAs, infrastructure administrators have less opportunity for unauthorized access and there are no implicit "trusted paths" to access the data without authorization/authentication/security contorl application.

### Choke point security

Since Acra sits on choke point to data access, it can enforce additional security restrictions on the data if you need it, and you can be sure that whoever wants to access plaintext will need to go through all these controls. 

## Acra's typical use cases

**TODO: FINISH**

**Secure data vault**: put your sensitive data in a separate database (PostgreSQL/mySQL-compatible), then protect it with Acra so that high-risk data has separate protection infrastrucutre built around it. 

**Quick integration of encryption**: quickly integrate Acra into existing applications that rely on MySQL/PostgreSQL-compatible databases as backends with minimum amount of re-engineering effort - days instead of months. 

**Developer-friendly data security module**: integrate a number of security controls in your application without diving into security detail too deeply. 

**Secure data lifecycle tool**: protect sensitive data's journey in your product, from database to all the microservices, backups, logs and all. Use single encryption model across data's lifecycle: encrypt in Acra as you write the data to database, pull encrypted text, pass it between microservices and decrypt later by talking to API service / SDK, while using keys from the same datastore. 

**Unified set of security controls towards data**: you don't need to maintain different software pieces implementing same security contorls in different places. 

## Major security features

**TODO: extend** 

* Cryptographic security: data is encrypted during storage and transmission via application-level and transport-level encryption with strong mutual authentication. 
* Searchable encryption: address encrypted records (use them in WHERE queries) without unnecessarily revealing them to the database.
* Selective encryption: you pick what, where and how gets encrypted.
* Key lifecycle tooling: flexible management of rolling/rotation/revocation to suit your load needs and data architecture. 
* SQL query firewall: prevent SQL injections, unauthorized queries, parse and log SQL queries
* Intrusion detection system: detect data leakage through several additional controls (honeytokens, DB traffic anomaly)
* Tokenisation (+optional encryption)
* Data masking
* Audit logging and security events
* Tamper-proof security for audit logging


## Key design principles

### Security

Major security design principles that you can achieve while using Acra: 

* Defense in depth: Acra delivers different layers of defense for different parts and stages of the data lifecycle. This is what defence in depth is â€“ an independent set of security controls aimed at mitigating multiple risks in case of an attacker crossing the outer perimeter.
* Trust compartmentalisation and strong isolation
* Zero trust: by default, nobody under no assumptions have access to the sensitive data if it's encrypted with Acra. 
* Secure by default. 
* Layered blend of protective, detective, responsive and recovery controls. 


### User experience

* **Quick and straightforward integration of security instrumentation**: there are many behavioural and organisational challenges which prevent security work from happening. To enable better security, security instrumentation should be as developer/operations friendly as possible. 
* **Hard to misuse**: world has a multitude of amazing security technologies. Unfortunately, if these technologies can be misused in a way that will lead to lowering of their security impact (with a false sense of security attached), they will be. Acra actively resists misuse that has security impact, where possible.
* **Crypto under the hood**: you don't have to become cryptography expert to use Acra, nor you can. Crypto details are abstracted away. 
* **Transparent and code-less integration**: in some of Acra's scenarios, it is possible to avoid changing your application code completely. 
* **Full operational control**: Acra provides logs, events, metrics and 360 degree operational and security overview into Acra's inside processes if you ned that. 


## Architecture 

**TODO: Review & expand, align terminology**

Acra allows you to keep various components of security system outside of main application architecture, securely keeping apart components that should not leak / become compromised together: 

* Encryption/decryption happens in separate components (proxies and APIs)
* Keys are stored separately, unpacked / delivered to encryption layer atomically, with key layout minimizing risks of massive leakage. 
* Privileged key management happens outside of main components. 
* Configuration is managed separately, delivered to each Acra component separately. 
* Audit trail is exportable to independent audit log storage in real-time. 

Acra CE consists of: 
* Security enforcement component (SQL proxy, API service/proxy, SDK)
* Key storage (Redis, table in your database, any KV store)
* Master key storage driver (plug into KMS / Vault)
... and a number of supporting utilities.

There are 3 basic form-factors of security enforcement components Acra provides: 

* SQL Proxy
* API service (with direct API and application SDKs to talk to that API)
* Privileged SDKs (enabling some operations to happen within application context)

... which allow you to construct infinitely sophisticated data flows with Acra: 

### Typical deployment architectures

1. Proxy (SQL)

Classic scenario: Acra sits between your application (or database-facing microservice) and the actual database, encrypting and decrypting data, using different means to

3. Complex - DAO API SDK Proxy complex

Acra was built to accompany sensitive data lifecycle in large, microservice-driven applications. So you can use APIs inside applications and proxies between some services and databases to build pretty sophisticated lifecycle:
