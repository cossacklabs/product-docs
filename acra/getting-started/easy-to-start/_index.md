We've made sure that this documentation service covers maximum of Acra's capabilities and configuration nuances. However, it is a considerable effort to do thorough study, so there are a few shortcuts for those willing to get their hands dirty faster:

They illustrate different facets of using Acra, from infrastructure integration to certain narrow product security problems. 

# Enterprise

To get to learn more about enterprise version, there are a few ways: 

## Evaluation playgrounds and pilots

For qualified potential customers interested in commercial version, we offer free playgrounds built around Acra EE and a number of demo applications - deployed in cloud of your choice, all set up for evaluation. Get your hands dirty without getting your hands dirty first! 

When certain customer use-cases require requires more effort than it is commercially reasonable to exert for free, we offer paid PoC's / pilots, where we build Acra deployment to your business requirements for a modest consulting fee. 

If you're interested in commercial version, please refer to (PLACEHOLDER for whatever the sales conversion funnel will be from here)
